# Addicted2Random-SpericalHarmonics

A work in progress development of an audio-reactive 3D structure in the browser for the EU project "Addicted2Random" by the Salzburg media artist Markus Brandt.     
Based on the geometry of spherical harmonies, audio data is represented as the movement of a 3D object in real time using Fourier analysis.
